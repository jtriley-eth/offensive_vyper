@title Coin Flipper Exploit

TARGET: `contracts/coin_flipper/coin_flipper.vy`

There's a coin flipping contract that costs 1 Ether to play, but pays out 2
Ether for winning tosses. One to Two at 50% expects everyone who plays to
break even. Your objective is to not break even. Capture the Ether, and do
it in a single transaction.

Good Hacking.
