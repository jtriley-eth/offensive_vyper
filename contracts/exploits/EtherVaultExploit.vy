@title Ether Liquidity Pool Exploit

TARGET: `contracts/ether_vault/ether_vault.vy`

There's an Ether vault that allows deposits and withdrawals. Your objective is
to take all the Ether from the vault. You might even kick off a hard fork with
the amount of Ether you're about to take. As usual, do it in a single
transaction.

Good Hacking.
